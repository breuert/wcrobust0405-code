# IRC - CENTRE2019

This repository contains our adapted code submissions of [CENTRE@CLEF2019](http://www.centre-eval.org/clef2019/) for the [Open-Source IR Replicability Challenge (OSIRRC 2019) at SIGIR 2019](https://osirrc.github.io/osirrc2019/).

Our replicated/reproduced runs 'WCRobust04' and 'WCRobust0405' are based on this [paper](https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec26/papers/WaterlooCormack-CC.pdf) by Grossman et al.

We adapted our [original submission](https://bitbucket.org/centre_eval/c2019_irc/) to the [OSIRRC jig](https://github.com/osirrc/jig/). For more information about how to use it, have a look at the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/osirrc/irc-centre2019-docker).
